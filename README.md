Hiya folks! Here at Soko Micro Services, we've added Travis-CI support to our Dynamic-Doggo! You can tell by the fancy badge!

# What is Dynamic Doggo?

Dynamic Doggo is a small to medium scale `React App` boiler plate.

This boiler plate can be hooked up to the database of your choosing, whether it's MongoDB, or MySQL.

## Some guidelines

- This boiler plate was made to use SoC principles.
- Each component you build should be self contained in it's own folder.
- npm scripts for building and serving are found in the package.json folder.
